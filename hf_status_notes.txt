HuggingFace Inference API Status Notes
====================================

Current Status: DOWN (As of April 2024)
Issue: HuggingFace Inference API is experiencing widespread issues affecting model inference.

Monitoring Setup:
- Automated status checks every 5 minutes via frontend
- Backend verification before each API call
- Warning banner displays when service is down

Recovery Steps:
1. API will automatically resume when HuggingFace services are restored
2. No manual intervention needed
3. Warning banner will automatically hide when service is back online

Alternative Options During Downtime:
1. Consider implementing local model inference
2. Look into HuggingFace Inference Endpoints (paid service)
3. Explore alternative API providers
